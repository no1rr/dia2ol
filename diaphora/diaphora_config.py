# getting the match from previously known good matches, even if our internal
# function to calculate similarity gives out the same ratio, we know for a fact
# that the match found by diffing matches is *the* match. To prevent such little
# problems, we just add this value to the calculated ratio and that's about it.
#
# Update: Initially, it was only used for matches found by diffing previous good
# known matches. However, it's also used now for matches where the function name
# is the same for both because, believe it or not, there can be another function
