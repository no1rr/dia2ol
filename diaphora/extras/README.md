# Diaphora local

This is a pure Python IDA plugin to diff pseudo-codes and assembly for functions inside the current binary, instead of diffing functions in different binaries.

# Installation

Simply copy this script in the directory `$IDA_DIR/plugins`.

# Usage

Put the cursor in IDA in some function and press Ctrl + Shift + D, choose the function to diff against the current function and 2 choosers (windows) will open showing the differences at pseudo-code and assembly levels.
