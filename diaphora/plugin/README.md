# Diaphora as an integrated IDA plugin

This is a very basic wrapper for integrating Diaphora as a plugin in IDA Pro.
In order to install it just do the following:

 * Copy `diaphora_plugin.py` and `diaphora_plugin.cfg` to the IDA's plugins directory.
 * Edit `diaphora_plugin.cfg` and set the `path` value to the Diaphora's directory.

This is a very basic wrapper. It will be enhanced in the future.
